I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at [Colorado School of Mines](https://cs.mines.edu/) with a joint appointment at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/). I work at the intersection of databases, knowledge graphs, the built environment and the Internet of Things. I am driven by building practical, efficient systems with open-source implementations that are proved through real-world deployments.

My research interests include (1) the design and implementation of high-performance databases, including graph and linked-data databases and timeseries databases; (2) IoT platforms that incorporate edge computing and cloud resources; (3) issues of digitization and data management in the built environment; (4) novel datasets or applications of data that motivate new data management techniques and abstractions.

Much of my current research enables novel software-defined sustainability and efficiency practices in the built-environment.
This includes developing new data management techniques and systems for buildings, energy, and water systems that leverage semantic metadata and knowledge graphs to enable data interoperability, sharing, and reuse.
I'm very interested in how these new data management techniques change the way we develop software in these hetergeneous, complex and cyber-physical settings.
I also work on the design of next-generation IoT platforms that incorporate edge computing and cloud resources to support data-driven applications in smart cities and smart buildings.
