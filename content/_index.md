I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at [Colorado School of Mines](https://cs.mines.edu/) with a joint appointment at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/). I work at the intersection of databases, knowledge graphs, the built environment and the Internet of Things. I am driven by building practical, efficient systems with open-source implementations that are proved through real-world deployments.

My research interests include (1) the design and implementation of high-performance databases, including graph and linked-data databases and timeseries databases; (2) IoT platforms that incorporate edge computing and cloud resources; (3) issues of digitization and data management in the built environment; (4) novel datasets or applications of data that motivate new data management techniques and abstractions.

## Projects and Grants

* Enhancing Data-Driven Science for Water Treatment Pilot Systems with Semantic Metadata Management: Funded by the [National Alliance for Water Innovation](https://www.nawihub.org) to research and develop metadata ontologies for water resource recovery systems
* [BuildingMOTIF](https://github.com/NREL/BuildingMOTIF): open-source SDK for building metadata model creation, storage, visualization, and validation
* [ASHRAE 223P](https://open223.info): semantic metadata standard for buildings, developed through the ASHRAE [Semantic Interoperability Working Group](http://www.bacnet.org/WG/SI/index.html)
* [Brick Ontology]({{< ref "projects#brick">}}): an open-source ontology and data model for data-driven smart building applications
* [Mortar]({{< ref "projects#mortar" >}}): a testbed and platform for "self-adapting" building analytics: write your code once and run it on 10s or 100s of buildings without changing a line of configuration or code
* *(past)* [Skewering the Silos](https://www.energy.gov/nepa/downloads/cx-101494-skewering-silos-using-brick-enable-portable-analytics-modeling-and-controls) (DE-EE0008681) is a DOE grant to continue development of Brick, in particular to expand its interoperability with existing metadata representations ([Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/), [gbXML](https://www.gbxml.org/), [Modelica](https://modelica.org/), [OpenBuildingControl/CDL](http://obc.lbl.gov/) and [BuildingSync](https://buildingsync.net/)) and develop additional analytics and controls applications
