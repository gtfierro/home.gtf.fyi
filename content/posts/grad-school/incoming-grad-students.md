# Resources for Incoming Graduate Students

This page is an incomplete list of useful resources and tips for incoming graduate students at Colorado School of Mines. I've sourced these links from current graduate students at Mines, who know far better then me what resources were helpful to them! If there is anything missing or incorrect, please send me an email.

## General Resources

- [Graduate Student Government page](https://gsg.mines.edu): a wonderful organization at Mines by graduate students for graduate students; links, resources, and contacts
- [CASA](https://www.mines.edu/casa/): student advising center; great for academic and scheduling support
- Read the Daily Blast, the daily campus email, for events and resources
- [Get familiar with your degree requirements](https://cs.mines.edu/graduate-program/) with additional specifics [here](https://catalog.mines.edu/graduate/programs/cs/#majortext); this will help you know what to expect, but be sure to regularly discuss degree progress with your advisor

## Housing

- [Mines Park](https://www.mines.edu/residence-life/mines-park/): nearby university-run apartment complex with amenities. Reduced availability for 2023-24 due to renovations, but an excellent option for students.
- [Off-campus housing facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mineslist); not affiliated with Mines; other groups are *"Golden/arvada/denver roommates & housing"* and *"CSM housing, sublets & roommates"*. Feel free to make an "In Search Of" post telling people what you are looking for
- Look for Facebook, Craigslist or other groups online using keywords like "Golden housing" or "Denver housing"
- Living near campus (in Golden) can be expensive, but there are plans for a future bus line connecting campus to the train station at the Jefferson County courthouse and South Golden road.

## International Students

- [International Student Council](https://orgs.mines.edu/isc/about-isc/): advocacy and support for international students; helps to coordinate international student organizations on campus; great place to find student clubs
- [Housing] A few international students have indicated that Mines Park (above) is a popular housing location for many international students
- Mines Graduate Student Government (GSG) has an equity/international student officer and an international student council representative; look on the GSG site above to find their contact information
- There are a number of WeChat groups, Slack rooms, Discord servers, and other online social locations which have grown organically from students from certain countries and identities. Email the CS graduate student mailing list for specifics
