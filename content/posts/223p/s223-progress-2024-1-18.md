I get enough questions about the current state of ASHRAE 223P{{< sn >}}https://www.ashrae.org/news/esociety/ashrae-bacnet-committee-works-with-other-organizations-on-new-standard{{</ sn >}} that it was worth
putting together a quick post collecting some of the slide decks, papers, and online resources that have emerged.

### Open223

The current best resource for learning about 223P is the [Open223](https://open223.info) project.
Open223 "is a collection of permissively-licensed open-source tools to facilitate exploration and usage of the emerging ASHRAE 223P standard. These tools are neither developed nor endorsed by ASHRAE -- instead, they are maintained by a small community of enthusiasts and developers who believe in making RDF data easier to use."

The Open223 suite of tools includes:
- [docs.open223.info](https://docs.open223.info/intro.html): user guide and overview of 223P
- [models.open223.info](https://models.open223.info/intro.html): example models and queries


Current development on Brick/Haystack harmonization can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/gtfierro/Brick-Haystack-harmonization)

### Papers

[Here](https://gtf.fyi/files/223P_Brick_Haystack.pdf) is a slightly-outdated paper about 223P + Brick ( + RealEstateCore) + Project Haystack together. The high-level vision remains the same.

### Slide Decks

- [This](https://gtf.fyi/files/2023-NREL-Haystack-Connect-Presentation.pdf) presentation I gave at Haystack Connect 2023 talks mostly about Brick/Haystack harmonization, but also talks about what future integration with ASHRAE 223P could look like
- [This](https://gtf.fyi/files/Original-2023-ASHRAE-BuildingMOTIF-Tutorial-Fierro.pdf) presentation I gave at an ASHRAE conference in 2023 talks about NREL's [BuildingMOTIF](https://github.com/NREL/BuildingMOTIF) tool and how it will facilitate usage of 223P
