#### add a sidebar to the main page which lists the 3 most recent blog posts plus a short snippet  

To add a sidebar with the 3 most recent blog posts and a short snippet, we'll modify the `themes/researcher/layouts/index.html` file.

Here are the changes:

themes/researcher/layouts/index.html
````html
<<<<<<< SEARCH
<div class="container">
    {{ .Content }}
</div>
=======
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Recent Posts</h3>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````

This change will create a sidebar on the main page that lists the 3 most recent blog posts with a short snippet for each.

> You can use /undo to undo and discard each aider commit.  

#### change this so it only works on pages in the posts folder  

To ensure the sidebar only appears on pages in the `posts` folder, we need to update the `themes/researcher/layouts/index.html` file to check the section.

Here are the changes:

themes/researcher/layouts/index.html
````html
<<<<<<< SEARCH
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Recent Posts</h3>
            <ul>
                {{ range first 3 .Site.RegularPages.ByDate }}
                <li>
                    <a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a>

                {{ end }}
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Recent Posts</h3>

                <li>
                    <a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a>
                    <p>{{ .Summary }}</p>
                </li>
                {{ end }}
            </ul>
        </div>
        {{ end }}
    </div>
</div>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````

This change ensures the sidebar is only displayed on pages within the `posts` section.

#### have the sidebar display pages of type 'post'  

To update the sidebar to display pages of type 'post', modify the `themes/researcher/layouts/index.html` file as follows:

themes/researcher/layouts/index.html
````html
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                {{ range first 3 (where .Site.RegularPages "Section" "posts").ByDate }}
=======
                {{ range first 3 (where .Site.RegularPages.ByDate "Type" "post") }}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````

This change will ensure the sidebar lists the most recent pages of type 'post'.

#### give feedback on the theme CSS in terms of making the site readable  

To improve the readability of your site's CSS, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Contrast and Color Scheme**: Ensure that the text color contrasts well with the background color. The current `$black` and `$white` colors are good, but ensure that any other colors used for text or backgrounds maintain a high contrast ratio for readability.

2. **Font Size and Line Height**: The default font size and line height should be comfortable for reading. The current line height of `1.2` might be a bit tight for body text. Consider increasing it to `1.5` for better readability.

3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the CSS is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes. The use of Bootstrap should help with this, but verify that all elements scale appropriately.

4. **Whitespace and Margins**: Adequate whitespace and margins can make the content easier to read. The current `$y-small` and `$y-medium` margins are a good start, but ensure they are applied consistently across all elements.

5. **Font Family**: The use of a custom font like "Berkeley" is fine, but ensure it is legible at various sizes. Consider providing a fallback font in case the custom font fails to load.

6. **Link Styles**: Ensure that links are easily distinguishable from regular text. The current link styles are good, but ensure they are consistent and provide a clear visual cue.

7. **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility features such as focus states for interactive elements and ensuring that all text is readable by screen readers.

If you would like to implement any specific changes based on these suggestions, let me know!

#### add a fallback monospace font  

To add a fallback monospace font to your CSS, we will update the `font-family` declaration in the `themes/researcher/assets/sass/researcher.scss` file. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/assets/sass/researcher.scss
```scss
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  font-family: "Berkeley";
=======
  font-family: "Berkeley", "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Commit abb208a feat: Add fallback monospace font to font-family declaration  
> You can use /undo to undo and discard each aider commit.  

#### make the site with a little wider, and make sure it is responseive  

To make the site a little wider and ensure it remains responsive, we will adjust the maximum width in the CSS. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/assets/sass/researcher.scss
```scss
<<<<<<< SEARCH
$max-width: {{ .Param "style.pageWidth" | default "750px;" }};
=======
$max-width: {{ .Param "style.pageWidth" | default "900px;" }};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change increases the default maximum width from 750px to 900px, providing a bit more space for content while maintaining responsiveness.

#### make sure the sidebar font is way smaller  

To make the sidebar font smaller, we will adjust the font size in the CSS. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/assets/sass/researcher.scss
```scss
<<<<<<< SEARCH
.nav-link {
    @extend %link-default;
}
=======
.nav-link {
    @extend %link-default;
    font-size: 0.8rem; // Smaller font size for sidebar links
}

> Commit c5dba6e style: Reduce sidebar font size for better readability  
> You can use /undo to undo and discard each aider commit.  

#### make sure this applies to the posts list in index.html  

To ensure the smaller font size applies to the posts list in `index.html`, we will add a specific class to the list items and adjust the CSS accordingly. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/layouts/index.html
```html
<<<<<<< SEARCH

#### in this posts lists, put the newest one on top  

To ensure the newest posts are listed on top, we need to reverse the order of the posts in the lists. Here are the changes:

themes/researcher/layouts/index.html
```html
<<<<<<< SEARCH
<ul class="post-list">
    {{ range last 3 .Site.RegularPages.ByDate }}
    <li>
        <p>{{ .Date.Format "2006-01-02" }}</p>

</ul>

> You can use /undo to undo and discard each aider commit.  

#### put a little more space between them  

To add more space between the list items in the posts list, we can adjust the CSS to include a margin for the list items. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/assets/sass/researcher.scss
```scss
<<<<<<< SEARCH
.post-list {
    font-size: 0.8rem; // Smaller font size for post list
}
=======
.post-list {
    font-size: 0.8rem; // Smaller font size for post list
    li {
        margin-bottom: 0.5rem; // Add space between list items
    }
}

> You can use /undo to undo and discard each aider commit.  

#### have the recent posts lists only have a limited height so that the content wraps under neath it  

To limit the height of the recent posts list and allow content to wrap underneath, we can apply a CSS style to set a maximum height and enable scrolling if necessary. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/assets/sass/researcher.scss
```scss
<<<<<<< SEARCH
.post-list {
    font-size: 0.8rem; // Smaller font size for post list
    li {
        margin-bottom: 0.5rem; // Add space between list items

}

#### have the recent posts lists only have a limited height so that the content in the main body can wrap underneath  

To limit the height of the recent posts list and allow the main content to wrap underneath, we will apply a CSS style to set a maximum height and enable scrolling if necessary. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/assets/sass/researcher.scss
```scss

#### Make the posts list a floating element  

To make the posts list a floating element, we will adjust the CSS to float the element and ensure the main content wraps around it. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/assets/sass/researcher.scss
```scss

#### Make the posts list a floating element  

To make the posts list a floating element, we will adjust the HTML and CSS to float the element and ensure the main content wraps around it. Here are the changes:

themes/researcher/layouts/index.html
```html

#### put a "recent papers" underneath the "recnet posts"  

To add a "Recent Papers" section underneath the "Recent Posts" in the sidebar, we will update the `themes/researcher/layouts/index.html` file. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/layouts/index.html
```html
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        </div>
=======
            <h3>Recent Papers</h3>
            <ul class="paper-list">
                {{ range first 3 .Site.Data.papers }}
                <li>
                    {{ .date }} <a href="{{ .url }}">{{ .title }}</a>
                </li>
                {{ end }}
            </ul>
        </div>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
``` 

This change assumes you have a data file (e.g., `data/papers.yaml`) with recent papers information. If you need to create this data file, let me know!

#### change the recent papers lists to sort by year and month fields  

To sort the recent papers list by year and month fields, we need to modify the `themes/researcher/layouts/index.html` file to sort the papers before displaying them. Here is the change:

themes/researcher/layouts/index.html
```html
<<<<<<< SEARCH

To list the recent papers in reverse order, we need to modify the `themes/researcher/layouts/index.html` file to reverse the order of the sorted papers. Here is the change:

#### that did nothing  

To list the recent papers in reverse order, we need to modify the `themes/researcher/layouts/index.html` file to reverse the order of the sorted papers. Here is the change:

themes/researcher/layouts/index.html

#### change the post list layout so that clicking the 'taxonomy' category takes you to a new page which lists all posts in that category  

To make the taxonomy category clickable and direct to a new page listing all posts in that category, we need to modify the `themes/researcher/layouts/_default/list.html` file. Here is the change:

themes/researcher/layouts/_default/list.html
```html
<<<<<<< SEARCH

The error in the code is likely due to the incorrect use of the `relLangURL` function. It should be used with a single argument. Let's fix this by concatenating the URL parts correctly:

themes/researcher/layouts/_default/list.html
```html
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <b><a href="{{ "/categories/" | relLangURL }}{{ $key | urlize }}">{{ title $key }}</a></b>

The error is likely due to the incorrect use of the `relLangURL` function. Let's fix this by ensuring the URL is constructed correctly:

themes/researcher/layouts/_default/list.html
```html
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <b><a href="{{ (printf "/categories/%s" $key | urlize | relLangURL) }}">{{ title $key }}</a></b>
=======
        <b><a href="{{ (printf "/categories/%s" $key | urlize) | relLangURL }}">{{ title $key }}</a></b>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

#### change the post list layout so that clicking the 'taxonomy' category takes you to a new page which lists all posts in that category  

To implement the change so that clicking on a category takes you to a new page listing all posts in that category, we need to modify the link for each category to point to its respective page. Here's the change:

themes/researcher/layouts/_default/list.html
```html
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <b>{{ title $key }}</b>
=======
        <b><a href="{{ "categories/" | relLangURL }}{{ $key | urlize }}">{{ title $key }}</a></b>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will create a link for each category that points to a page listing all posts in that category.
