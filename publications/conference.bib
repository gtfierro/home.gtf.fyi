Please note that for some conference entries, the 'pdf' value was missing, and as such the 'url' field for those entries was populated with a placeholder (`https://home.gtf.fyi/papers/`). You will need to replace these with the correct URLs if they become available. Also, for the last two entries that are scheduled for future dates (such as SIGCSE 2024 and ICCPS 2024), no 'pdf' values were provided, so they were not included in the BibTeX entries above. If PDFs become available for these, they will need to be added manually.
